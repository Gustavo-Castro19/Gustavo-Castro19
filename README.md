Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Gustavo, an enthusiastic IT student constantly exploring the depths of computer science and the art of programming. My main focus is on C and imperative programming paradigms, but I’m always curious to expand my horizons in both technology and the written word.

### 👨‍💻 About Me
- **IT undergraduate** fascinated by how computers work at their core.
- **Enjoys digging deep into C** and understanding how things run “under the hood.”
- **Avid reader and technology aficionado** – I believe true innovation comes from blending diverse fields like literature and computing.

### ⚡ Fun Facts
- I love discussing both technological trends and classic literature.
- Always up for a challenge—be it solving tricky programming problems or unraveling a good book.
